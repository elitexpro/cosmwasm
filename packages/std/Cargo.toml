[features]
# iterator allows us to iterate over all DB items in a given range
# optional as some merkle stores (like tries) don't support this
# given Ethereum 1.0, 2.0, Substrate, and other major projects use Tries
# we keep this optional, to allow possible future integration (or different Cosmos Backends)
iterator = []
# backtraces provides much better context at runtime errors (in non-wasm code)
# at the cost of a bit of code size and performance.
